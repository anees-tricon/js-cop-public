# Puzzle on javascript logical operator and TS

This is a simple code which works on dates.
You would call this function as

```js
const isActive = isActiveMonth(3,2020)
if(isActive) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

As you can see in `src/index.ts`, the function essentially returns a value with which we make a decision.

```js
return (
  (start &&
    start.getMonth() === monthToBeChecked &&
    start.getFullYear() === yearToBeChecked) ||
  (end &&
    end.getMonth() === monthToBeChecked &&
    end.getFullYear() === yearToBeChecked)
);
```

But looking at the return type of the function, we can see that the function returns either of true, false and null.

Ideally it should return a boolean as we are using logical operators.

As part of the puzzle, you have to do the following.

1. Identify why the output is not just boolean and provide the explanation in the readme section below.
2. Change the code so that the type will be `boolean` and not `boolean | null`.
3. Make sure the existing test cases are all passing(4 are failing right now).
4. Raise a PR containing changed code and the updated Readme.

## Explanation (point 1)

The return type of the method can also be null because...
the && oprator returns the first falsy value while evaluating from left to right.

null && false // will return null because the first operand is falsy and it returns null.

There are two ways to convert non-boolean to boolean
Boolean(value)
!!value

## Engine

This code has been tested on node v14.13.1 and npm v6.14.8. It should work on earlier versions as well.
